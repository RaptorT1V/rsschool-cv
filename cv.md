## 🇬🇧 English language
Level: _B1-B2_  
At school, English was one of my favourite subjects, along with algebra and Russian. I often participated in Olympiads and competitions.  
I practise the language in conversational chats on English Discord servers, and also watch content on YouTube in English without subtitles.
